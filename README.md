# Noteworthy

Hi, this is a repo that I use to take down anything noteworthy, especially things that I find interesting or things that I struggled to understand/implement/use. I hope that this repo would not only be able to help myself but others as well who were struggling with the same issues. Thanks for stopping bye :)

This repo uses [docsify](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify). 
To run the site locally, run `python -m http.server 3000` in the root directory of this repo.
