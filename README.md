# Noteworthy

Hi, this is a repo that I use to take down anything noteworthy, especially things that I find interesting or things that I struggled to understand/implement/use. I hope that this repo would not only be able to help myself but others as well who were struggling with the same issues. Thanks for stopping bye :)
